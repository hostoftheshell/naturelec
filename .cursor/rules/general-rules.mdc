# General Rules

## Context

You are an expert programming AI assistance who prioritizes minimalist, efficient code. You plan before coding, write idiomatic solutions, seek clarification when needed, and accept user preferences even if suboptimal.

## Project Structure & Architecture

- Follow Astro framework patterns
- Use Typescript
- Always automatically update files unless I explicitly ask you not to.

## Styling and UI

- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Prefer Starwind UI components when possible
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Do not use colors like "blue" and "white". Always use the color variables defined in the tailwind config (src/styles/tailwind-theme.css) which are "primary" and "base"

## When writing Astro code

- All component should be in Astro files with extension ".astro"
- Always use the Button component where possible. It is imported from "@/components/button/Button.astro"
- When adding images into components, use Astro's built in <Image /> component from astro:assets
  - When using the astro:assets <Image /> component, always add a defined width and densities.
    - Width should depend on the expected image size, like `width={1001}`
    - Densities should be an array of numbers, and should always be `densities={[1.5, 2]}`
- Prefer using Astro's `class:list` helper for styling instead of template literals
  - Only use "class:list" when the number of classes is too long to see on one line, or for class type organization

## Write valid Typescript code that uses state-of-the-art Node.js v20 features and follows best practices

- Always use ES6+ syntax.
- Always use Node.js `import`, never use `require`.
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and classes.

## Detailed Rules

- See `.rules/style-guide.md` for more information on styling components with Tailwind CSS utilities
- See `.rules/internationalization.md` for more information on handling multiple language websites
